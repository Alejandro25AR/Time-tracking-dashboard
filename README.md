## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- SCSS with BEMIT
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS Vanilla

### What I learned

- I reinforced the flexbox concepts and the work with the BEMIT convention.
- I learned about the guard clauses to decrease identation levels and improve code readability.

### Continued development

- The BEMIT convention is very useful because it allows us to write maintainable styles.
- The use of guard clauses to make the source code more readable and maintainable.
